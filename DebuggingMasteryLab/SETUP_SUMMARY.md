# Project Setup Summary

## What We've Done

1. **Created the Basic .NET Console Application**
   - Set up the DebuggingMasteryLab project
   - Added the initial Program.cs with the buggy code for Lab 1
   - Created a solution file for easier management

2. **Prepared Documentation**
   - Created a comprehensive README.md with course overview
   - Added detailed lab instructions for Lab 1 and Lab 2
   - Created a GETTING_STARTED.md guide with setup instructions

3. **Set up Version Control**
   - Added a .gitignore file for .NET projects
   - Created a setup_branches.sh script to establish all lab branches
   - Committed the initial project structure

## Next Steps

1. **Run the setup_branches.sh script** to create all the lab branches

2. **For Each Lab Branch:**
   - Add the specific buggy code for that lab scenario
   - Create a detailed lab instruction markdown file
   - Add a solutions folder with the reference implementation

3. **Push All Branches to the Remote Repository**
   ```bash
   git push origin --all
   ```

4. **Test the Project Setup**
   - Clone the repository freshly
   - Follow the GETTING_STARTED.md instructions
   - Verify that all labs can be completed as intended

## Additional Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Add CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Set up GitHub Actions to verify that solutions build correctly

2. **Add Visual Studio Code Support**
   - Create .vscode folder with launch.json and tasks.json
   - Ensure VS Code debugging works smoothly

3. **Create PDF Documentation**
   - Convert markdown documentation to PDF for offline reference
